                    <h3>Food For Children</h3>
                    <p>Nutrition for kids is based on the same principles as nutrition for adults. Everyone needs the
                        same
                        types of nutrients,such as vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, protein and fat. Children,
                        however, need different amounts of specific nutrients at different ages.</p>

                    <p>Around the world, children are deprived of education and learning for various reasons. Poverty
                        remains one of the most obstinate barriers. Children living through economic fragility,
                        political instability, conflict or natural disaster are more likely to be cut off from
                        schooling.</p>
